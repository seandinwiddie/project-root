## Purpose
one of the major purposes of this project is to create a modular JavaScript application architecture that is easily extensible, scalable, and maintainable

The architecture is designed to allow me to build scalable applications by breaking them down into smaller modules, each with its own set of actions, reducers, and components

This approach enables me to build applications in a way that is more modular, easier to test, and easier to maintain

Another major purpose is to play out some particular scenerios in a MUD style fasion

## Goals
The first tier of primary goals for this project are:
- To provide a modular architecture that is easy to use and extend
- To encourage code reusability/scalability and maintainability
- To enable me to build a scalable application by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable modules
- To make it easier for me to test my code

The next tier of goals for this project are:
- Create a text prompt style interactive navigation into various mystical simulations

## Target Audience
One target audience of this project could be JavaScript developers who are interested in building particular applications that are easy to maintain and extend, such as myself

designed for developers who want to learn about modular application architectures and rapid development practices for building large-scale applications

The project assumes a basic understanding of JavaScript, React, and Redux, but it is designed to be accessible to developers of all skill levels

another audience could be those interested in a unique way of discovering and unlocking veins of gold with in the cyber dimension
explicitly in learning languages, play rpgs, and going through courses
