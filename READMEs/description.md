# description
web application for generating DnD characters

simple application that guides users through the process of creating a DnD character

It uses Redux to manage the state of the application

It uses React to render the application

## tech stack

redux
react
babel( typescript maybe later )
yet undefined ui kit or a command-line, terminal-style emulator
React Native w/ Expo go ( for native apps )
React Native for Web or equivalent

## roadmap

the next step is to adjust the user interface, user experience, and application flow.

the interface will be a command-line, terminal, prompt style.

there will be a series of questions and guidance and interactivity via user-typed commands that will feel very similar if not almost exactly the same as playing MUDs

### Further fleshing out

Eventually, the app will integrate solo TTRPG rules for gameplay and playing as a (solo)MUD

#### Next

Afterwards that specific story campaigns and skill teaching will be implemented

examples of skills to be taught would be new languages and that sort of thing

also new paradigms and mindsets and traditions

the story campaigns will incorporate ritual and visionary "magic" with intention and catalyst-guided mediations played out as gameplay mechanics including Vision Questing, Defining(discovering) Intent and Catalyst, Initiating Transition, ritual Practices, pathworking, astral projection, etc

##### backlog: native apps

react-native / expo go planned for the future

React Native and React are not fully compatible, as the syntax and functionality of each differ slightly

While both use similar components and JSX syntax, React Native compiles to native mobile app components, while React compiles to HTML components for the web

However, there is a compatibility layer called React Native for Web that allows developers to use React Native code in web applications using React DOM

##### backlog: moduales: core rules and pdf reports

addon modules will be developed for

world of darkness dark ages

world of darkness

chonicles of darkness

consulting accelerator

mind movies

other mindset courses and ttrpg rulesets

also report genaration of things like charaters and adventure logs and mindset discovery
