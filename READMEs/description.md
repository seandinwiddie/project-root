web application for generating DnD characters

simple application that guides users through the process of creating a DnD character

It uses Redux to manage the state of the application

It uses React to render the application

## roadmap

the next step is to adjust the user interface, user experience, and application flow.

the interface will be a command-line, terminal, prompt style.

there will be a series of questions and guidence and interactivity via user typed commands that will feel very similar if not almost exactly the same as playing MUDs

### native apps

react native / expo go planned for the future

React Native and React are not fully compatible, as the syntax and functionality of each differ slightly

While both use similar components and JSX syntax, React Native compiles to native mobile app components, while React compiles to HTML components for the web

However, there is a compatibility layer called React Native for Web that allows developers to use React Native code in web applications using React DOM
