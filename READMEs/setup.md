## Setup

To run this application, you can simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser

Make sure you have a stable internet connection as the application uses CDN links for React, Redux and Babel

1. Start `server: npm start`
Start the application by running `npm start`.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/project-root`

FYI:

Access to XMLHttpRequest from origin 'null' can be blocked by CORS policy as Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, isolated-app, chrome-extension, chrome, https, chrome-untrusted.

Running the node server resolves the CORS issue, but if the user simply opens the index.html file in their browser, they may run into that error
